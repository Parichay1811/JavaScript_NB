There are three types of structural scopes
    1. global scope
        whatever is there outside of the braces {}
    2. Block scope
        whatever is there inside of any braces {}
    3. Functional scope
       whatever is there inside of a function definition{}
logical scope:
    lexical scope: it defines the way how compiler is going to access the variable.
hoisting:
    variable which is decleared with var is gonna be hoisted to the top of the scope.
