object is used to write more than one line of code.
if any key contains a hyphen , it will be written as String.
let rick = {
    firstName : "Parichay",
    lastName : "Dutta Biswas",
    age : 25,
    isStudent : true
    "add-ress" : "hghggs"                   add-ress has been written as string. Otherwise it will throw an error
}

Implicit type convertion

let n1 = 10;
let n2 = '20';
console.log(n1 + n2); 

This will give us 1020 automatically it will convert the string into number and then add the two numbers. This is called implicit type conversion.

compare between == and ===
let a = 10
let b = '10'
console.log(a === b);       //false
console.log(a == b);        //true

== checks the value of the variable 
=== checks the value and data type of the variable.

=== checks the reference of the variable.
